<td valign="top" width="50%">
  
I am a 3rd-year student at Simon Fraser University, pursuing an undergraduate degree, <b>majoring in üíª Computer Engineering</b>, and intend to minor in Computing Sciences. I'm a coder at heart, with <b>C and Python</b> as my go-to languages, and I have a passion for all things tech üë®‚Äçüíª!

I started <b>self-learning üå± programming</b> when I was in middle school and since have been sharpening my skills further via my degree and always keeping on the hunt to learn more üî≠. Have a look at my projects on my GitHub profile. If you're curious about my journey so far, you can peek at my resume üìú on my portfolio:
